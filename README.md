# asana-ruby-script

A simple Ruby script for calling Asana from the command-line.

I've adapted the code from this [asana-client](https://github.com/tmacwill/asana-client).

# Why?

There's a few existing Asana commandline clients. But they're one of the following:

- Installed via `gem install`
- Installed via `brew install`

I find it easier to just make it a simple ruby script, and call it via an Bash alias.

This way, I can edit the script. And not worry about having to publish a brew or gem package.

# To install

- Git clone this repo
- Make an alias in your `.bash_profile` to call the script in this repo
